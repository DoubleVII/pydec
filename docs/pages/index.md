# Welcome to PyDec Documentation

PyDec is a linear decomposition toolkit for neural network based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), which can decompose the tensor in the forward process into given components with a small amount of code. The result of decomposition can be applied to tasks such as attribution analysis.

## Purpose

GitHub pages uses Jekyll natively, so when I make documentation, I typically
look for Jekyll templates. Why? Using Jekyll means that I can use markdown,
and allow for users to easily contribute, and build automatically just by
way of pushing to a master branch (or general GitHub pages).
I found Docsy, a beautiful Hugo template, but it requires hugo with GoLang
which doesn't render natively on GitHub pages. For this reason, I've spent
some time creating a custom Jekyll template that is (almost) as beautiful,
and includes all the features that I might want.
